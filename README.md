xwiimote wrapper for wiimote

i connect to wiimote with blueberry applet then in the xwiimote-wrapper/xwiimote build the lib then in demo run the demo from console with wiimote connected ./test 1 then it should show some numbers the gui is only partially working but is showing the accelerometer data the rest should be easy to get.
